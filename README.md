# American Sign Language Alphabet Classification
# (COMP_6721-SUMMER-PROJECT)

--> GROUP 07 <--

ASL is accepted by many high schools, colleges, and universities in fulfillment of modern and “foreign” language academic degree requirements across the United States. This project aims for ASL alphabet classification to facilitate better understanding and interaction with the ASL community. The goal is to develop a reliable and efficient tool for ASL alphabet recognition, which can bridge the communication gap between individuals with hearing impairments and those who do not know sign language. we will use PyTorch to build and train a deep learning model to classify images to classes.

Initial phase of project after one page documentation submission. Now , we have the document and dataset.
